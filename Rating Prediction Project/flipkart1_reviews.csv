I had made a replacement and the new piece also has the same issue. I'm sure many others would have noticed. It's very negligible like an earth shock but still a defect nonetheless.

1364,Worth every penny,"Only cons which were not deal breaker are
1. Hinge wobbling while typing aggressively or kept right under the fan with 5 speed.
2. Colours displayed on the screen are not vibrant they are dull but you got 144 Hz refresh rate so no need to worry.
3. Trackpad height is less Bcoz of that speaker grills, you can manage it by purchasing a mouse.
4.You can get the battery backup of 3.5 to 4 hours on light usage if your work is heavy you shouldn't expect a good battery life in a gaming laptop.

Received this yesterday. Got it for 37.5k
Nice performance in mid range. Seems very delicate. You have to use with care. If you are ruff and tuff user, should avoid. Very slim and light weight.

Battery is good. 4 to 5 hours
Cam is average.
Sound is good. Not very loud but clear.
Keyboard look is nice but build quality is delicate. Use keyboard guard.
Finger print scanner excellent.
Speed excellent for day to day usage. Played morden combat 5 and worked good.

If you are using for gaming and office use this is the best option you can get.

60hz panel is good since the fps won't get 100+ in 1650 so 144hz is more or less a marketing gimmick.

Ryzen 5 variant is more powerful than i5 11th gen.

4228,Nice product,Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.,4
4229,Good,"So basically, laptop is well and good. But the huge and huge and huge problem is battery. Battery is drains so fast that you can't imagine, and trust me those who personally use this laptop can say same, and second worst part about this laptop is it's speakers, seriously your mobile phone can play better sound than this laptop.

I personally have tried 2 games on it valorant and apex legends both runs on high setting with 60 fps. And even this gives me 60 fps with high settings while recording in Valor...

Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.

The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.

Other than that, no specific complaints so far. Using it for a month now. On time and secure delivery by Flipkart",4

Speakers are good. Much better than most in this price range

Only cons

6. Keyboard and touchpad looks professional.
7. Keyboard keys are smooth.

5141,Awesome,"Awesome purchase!!!

Build quality: it's sturdy for its budget only issue is that it attracts a lot of smudges

Ram 16gb 3200mhz: can handle all the load and it's lighting fast but it comes with single stick make sure to upgrade it to dual channel

Ryzen 7 5800H: with 8 cores and 16 threads you can pretty much do all your task but get's very hot under heavy gaming make sure to undervolt cpu and use laptop with cooling pad

Rtx 3060 6Gb: Can handle every game you name it..no complains here.

Future upgrade is for a single unit of ram, hdd/ssd(2.5 inch), and a pcie nvme ssd.
It works absolutely fantastic in this price category but only asus a15 tuf gaming is cheaper than this but got fhd 144hz screen.

This is the true replacement of the legendary GTX 1060. My old laptop was GTX 1060 and it still runs latest games at decent framerate. But this laptop is a beast! I am running Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition with Raytracing On and getting 70 + framerates! Thats just crazy. Another great thing, there are 4 exhaust vents to keep the laptop cool which is very m...
